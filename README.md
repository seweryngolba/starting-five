The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it lets you pick a Point Guard (PG), Shooting Guard (SG), Small Forward (SF), Power Forward (PF), and Center (C) from a predefined list of players.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. The application will display the title "Basketball Starting 5" at the top.
3. Below the title, you will find five player positions labeled "PG," "SG," "SF," "PF," and "C."
4. To randomly select a player for a position, click the corresponding "Get" button below that position. For example, to pick a Point Guard, click the "Get PG" button.
5. Once you click the "Get" button, the application will randomly choose a player from the predefined list for that position.
6. The selected player's name, jersey number, and a jersey icon with the player's last name initial will be displayed on the screen.
7. The jersey icon will be colored according to the player's team color, and the jersey number will have a color corresponding to the player's number color.
8. Repeat the process for other positions to complete the starting lineup.

- The CSS file `style.css` contains the styling for the application, including the colors and layout. You can modify this file to change the visual appearance of the app.

## Responsive Design

The application has been designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. It will display differently on small screens, such as mobile devices, and larger screens like tablets and desktops.
